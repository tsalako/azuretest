	<title>Phone of phones?</title>
	<body>Not met a bendy LG phone before? They’re pretty unusual. The top and bottom of the LG G Flex 2 stick out a bit, giving it a very light banana-like bend.
So it looks a bit odd, and any suggestions that it gives movies and games a whole new level of immersion are nonsense. But it is really very comfortable, especially given the LG G Flex 2 has a pretty large 5.5-inch screen. It’s comfy held upright, comfy held on its side watching Netflix: comfy all-round.
While the original LG G Flex had the same sort of design style, it was nowhere near as nice to hold. Mostly because it was ruddy gigantic: 6mm wider than the G Flex 2 thanks to its 6in screen. This new phone is much more like a normal handset. It’s almost as if LG seriously wants people to buy this one.
As with most other LG phones, the back is glossy plastic rather than metal or soft-touch stuff, but the shape is much more likely to strike you anyway. The red finish we got our G Flex 2 sample in is really lovely, too, with a brushed metal effect underneath all the gloss.</body>
